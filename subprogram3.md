# UNIT 3:"Subprograms and Recursion"
___

A subprogram is a sequence of instructions whose execution is invoked from one or more remote locations in a program, with the expectation that when the subprogram execution is complete, execution resumes at the instruction after the one that invoked the subprogram.In high-level languages, subprograms are also called subroutines, procedures, and functions. In object-oriented languages, they are usually called methods or constructors.In most modern high-level languages, subprograms can have parameters, local variables, and returned values.
