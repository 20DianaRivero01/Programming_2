# FINAL PROJECT
## WEB PAGE

This project is a Web page, to create this i used different tools. 

### SOFTWARES I USED 
* XAMP
* VisualCode
* Bootstrap Studio
* MySQL

### PROCESS
The main point of this program is to create a web page, which first you will see the home screen, then you will have two options: 
* **log in:** if you choose **log in**, you will enter your email and your password, if it correct it will sent you to another page which wills show "Welcome" and your email(user), that means that the database will recognize that you are register before, and also there will be an "log out" button which will send you to the **home page** . In other case, if you put and email that is not register or is incorrect and do not match with the password, the page will be the same until you enter an exit data.
* **sing in:** if you chose sing in, you will register as a new user so will have to add an email, a password and you must repeat the password to confirm, if both password match, you will be register in the database and then it will take you back to the home page, and now you can log in. if the passwords that you enter do not match, the program will stay in the same sing in page until you both passwords match.

I used Bootstarp Studio, just for take the design that i used from every page, also when I export each one, I tooked the code htlm from every design, it was just to analyze what variables the developer used and to take references of it so then i will see and adjust the botoms that i will use for the program.
In visual code I create a folder where I work my code, i used the lenguage php, it is old but it is used for create web pages. It took me a while to analyze the lenguage, but before I started programming I analyze the structure that I was about to code and then just transformed it into php lenguage.
