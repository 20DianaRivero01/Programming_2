# PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS 
***

A ***[Paradigm](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/)*** is a style, or “way,” of programming and is used as a method to solve some problems or do some task. Normally the way of solve the problems are by using a programming language and as we know, there are lots of programming language that are known, but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.(the instructions).

Apart from varieties of programming language paradigms has their classification to fulfil each and every demand. There are two types of paradigms:

### [Classification of Programming Paradigms](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.computer.org%2Fcsdl%2Fmagazine%2Fit%2F2011%2F05%2Fmit2011050030%2F13rRUwgQpnj&psig=AOvVaw110voNZwvcPUMWKf04Dbqh&ust=1589478714321000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKCA6-OzsekCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ)

### DECLARATIVE
***Declarative languages***, also called nonprocedural or very high level, are programming languages in which (ideally) a program specifies what is to be done rather than how to do it.

* **Functional:** It has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure. Examples: Python, Haskell, Lisp, Erlang y Clojure. 
* **Data Flow:** States that a program can be expressed as a directed graph through which data “flows” from start to finish.
* **Logic:** In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. The main emphasize is on the knowledge base and the problem.
* **Structure:** Programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection and repetition, block structures, and subroutines.
* **Template-base programming:** This paradigm is basically based on solving a problem dividing it into smaller problems. It works dividing into simpler problems, the aim is to obtain an easier solution.

### IMPERATIVE
The ***[Imperative Paradigm](http://jspring.cs.herts.ac.uk/The%20Imperative%20Paradigm.pdf)***Is a paradigm of computer programming in which the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer, it means that it explicitly tells the computer "how" to accomplish. The steps.

* **Von Neumann:** All the instructions previously read by a compiler are placed in instructions that the processor is going to execute at a certain moment, hence its name, assembly language
* **Interpreted (Scripting):** Assumes that a collection of useful components already exist in other languages. They are intended not for writing applications from scratch but rather for combining components.
* **Object-oriented:**  Real-world objects are each viewed as seperate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedures, called methods. 
* **Parallel Processing approach:** Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors. A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a program in less time by dividing them. This approach seems to be like divide and conquer.

### IMPLEMENTATION METHODS 
* **Interpreted programming:** It directly excecute source language programs, it fetch source programm, decode it and execute it, the interpreter excecutes while program executing.
* **Compiled programming:** It translate program from source language to target language, it program in target language is then executed, the compiler finished before program executed.
* **Source Code:** It is a set of lines of text with the steps the computer must follow to run a program. Is wrote in a programming language but is not ready to execute, it needs to be translated by a compiler

# **[DATA REPRESENTATIONS AND OPERATORS](https://gribblelab.org/CBootCamp/3_Basic_Types_Operators_And_Expressions.html#orga09d195)**
* **Identifiers:** They are names for entities in a C program, such as variables, arrays, functions, structures, unions and labels. An identifier can be composed only of uppercase, lowercase letters, underscore and digits, but should start only with an alphabet or an underscore. If the identifier is not used in an external link process, then it is called as internal. Example: Local variable. If the identifier is used in an external link process, then it is called as external. Example: Global variable

``` total    sum     average          _x        y_        mark_1           x1 ```

* **Variable:** Is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.

|TYPES OF VARIABLES|
|------------------|
|Integers          |
|Float             |
|Characters        |    
|Boolean           |
|Scape sequences   |
|String            |   

* **Constants:** Data values that stay the same every time a program is executed are known as constants. Constants are not expected to change.
* **Reserved word** Often found in programming languages and macros, reserved words are terms or phrases appropriated for special use that may not be utilized in the creation of variable names. For example, "print" is a reserved word because it is a function in many languages to show text on the screen.
* **Primitive data type:** In simple terms “data type” and “primitive data type” are simply known and used as interchangeable variables. Primitive data types are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming language. For example, integer, character, and string are all primitive data types.
